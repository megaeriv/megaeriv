## About Me
Graduate of the University of Aberdeen with an MSc in Petroleum Data Management, a passionate aspiring data analyst with experience in the downstream petroleum industry. As someone with an inquisitive mind and a desire to understand the reasoning behind outcomes and decisions, I became fascinated by data analysis. The following years have taught me how to code and analyze with my favourite programming language, R.

As a data analyst, I am passionate about uncovering insights and identifying patterns that can make a real difference to people and businesses.

R, Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI are a few of my technical skills

In addition to collaborating on projects, professionals in the data field are always welcome to connect with me.
