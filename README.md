## About Me
A recent MSc graduate from the University of Aberdeen, I am a passionate aspiring data analyst with industry experience in the downstream petroleum industry. I became fascinated by data analysis through my love of football, by winning arguments with facts. I have since then acquired gained skills in coding and analysing with my favourite programming language, R.

When I can leverage data to uncover insights and identify patterns that have a real impact on people and businesses, I get very excited. My technical skills consist of R, Python, SQL, Excel and Power BI

I am always happy to connect with new people in the data field and collaborate on projects revolving around football and energy data. I am always happy to connect with new people in the data field. You can find me on LinkedIn and at megaerivona@gmail.com.
