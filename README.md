## About Me
Graduate of the University of Aberdeen with an MSc in Petroleum Data Management, a passionate aspiring data analyst with experience in the downstream petroleum industry. As someone with an inquisitive mind and a desire to understand the reasoning behind outcomes and decisions, I became fascinated by data analysis and acquired skills to further aid in finding patters and insights that affect buisnesses and society. 

R, Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI are a few of my technical skills

In addition to collaborating on projects, professionals in the data field are always welcome to connect with me. Email me at megaerivona@gmail.com
